# ETL_Project

"Servicio Profesional de Carrera" is a public career portal owned by the Mexican Government where availiable jobs in any State Department Office are posted for the public to apply. Candidates are interviewed and selected based on their profile and skills through a fair and transparent process.

Although this platform exists, there are still many job positions which are never publicly announced but instead filled with people by other criteria that not necessarily involves a competitive and open recruiting process.

This project aims to create a database containing information about every job posted by any State Department Office in Mexico to "Servicio Profesional de Carrera" between 2013 and 2018 along with data about the performance of the different offices in terms of applied sanctions and employee satisfaction. The data in this set includes:

* The posted role, and the sector (i.e. Energy, Health, Public Service, etc) to which the State Department Office belongs.
* The number of Sanctions a sector received per trimester due to personnel misbehavior.
* The Empolyee Satisfaction Index given to each sector based on surveys.

A further analysis using this dataset will be conducted on a later stage to look for any existing and unknown relationships between the number of sanctions, the Employee Satisfaction Index and the ratio of empolyees hired through an open recruitment process vs. those who were not.
